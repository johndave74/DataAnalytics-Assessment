## üß† Per-Question Explanations

### **Assessment_Q1.sql ‚Äî High-Value Customers with Multiple Products**

**Objective:**  
Identify customers who have at least one funded savings plan **and** one funded investment plan. Rank them by total deposits.

**Approach:**
- Filter for funded savings and funded investment plans using JOINs.
- Group by customer and count savings/investment accounts.
- Sum the deposits to calculate total deposits.
- Sort by total deposits descending.

**Key Insight:**
This identifies cross-sell opportunities‚Äîideal for targeting high-value customers with multiple financial products.

**Challenge:**
Ensuring we didn‚Äôt double-count customers with multiple accounts required aggregation at the right level (`owner_id`).

### **Assessment_Q2.sql ‚Äî Transaction Frequency Analysis**

**Objective:**  
Classify customers based on their average monthly transaction frequency into:
- High Frequency (‚â•10/month)
- Medium Frequency (3‚Äì9/month)
- Low Frequency (‚â§2/month)

**Approach:**
- Count transactions per customer.
- Compute account tenure in months using `MIN(created_at)` and `MAX(created_at)`.
- Compute average monthly transactions.
- Use CASE statements to bucket customers by frequency category.
- Group and aggregate to get category summaries.

**Key Insight:**
Enables segmentation for personalized marketing, product recommendations, or churn prediction.

**Challenge:**
Correctly handling edge cases where transaction spans were less than a full month to avoid division by zero.

---

### **Assessment_Q3.sql ‚Äî Account Inactivity Alert**

**Objective:**  
Flag active savings or investment accounts that have **not had any inflow transactions in the last 365 days**.

**Approach:**
- Identify last inflow transaction (amount > 0) per account.
- Combine savings and investment accounts using `UNION ALL`.
- Filter where last inflow date is more than 365 days ago or NULL (never transacted).
- Calculate `inactivity_days` using `NOW() - last_transaction_date`.

**Key Insight:**
This is critical for proactive outreach and retention strategies for dormant accounts.

**Challenge:**
Ensuring we accounted for accounts that have **never** had any transactions (i.e., `last_transaction_date IS NULL`).

---

### **Assessment_Q4.sql ‚Äî Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation**

**Objective:**  
Estimate each customer's CLV using the formula:  
\[
CLV = \left( \frac{\text{Total Transactions}}{\text{Tenure in Months}} \right) \times 12 \times \text{Avg Profit per Transaction}
\]  
Assume profit per transaction is **0.1% of transaction value**.

**Approach:**
- Compute total number and value of transactions per customer.
- Compute tenure in months from `date_joined` to `NOW()`.
- Calculate average profit per transaction (`0.001 √ó total_value / count`).
- Use the formula above to compute CLV.
- Sort descending by CLV.

**Key Insight:**
Helps prioritize marketing or retention efforts toward the most valuable customers.

**Challenge:**
Handling tenure values of zero or NULL and avoiding division by zero via `NULLIF`.
